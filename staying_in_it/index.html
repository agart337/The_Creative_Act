        The artist’s job is never truly finished.
        <br>
        <br>
        In many occupations, when we go home, we leave our work behind at the office. The artist is always on call. Even
        after we get up from hours engaged in our craft, the clock is still running.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is because the artist’s job is of two kinds:
        <br>
        The work of doing.
        <br>
        The work of being.
        <br>
        <br>
        Creativity is something you are, not only something you do. It’s a way of
        <br>
        <br>
        moving through the world, every minute, every day. If you’re not driven to an unrealistic standard of
        dedication, it may not be the path for you. So much of the artist’s work is about balance, so it’s ironic that
        this way of life leaves little room for it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once you acquiesce to the demands of the creative life, it becomes a part of you. Even in the midst of a
        project, you still look for new ideas each day. At any moment, you’re prepared to stop what you’re doing to make
        a note or a drawing, or capture a fleeting thought. It becomes second nature. And we’re always in it, every hour
        of the day.
        <br>
        <br>
        Staying in it means a commitment to remain open to what’s around you. Paying attention and listening. Looking
        for connections and relationships in the outside world. Searching for beauty. Seeking stories. Noticing what you
        find interesting, what makes you lean forward. And knowing all of this is available to use next time you sit
        down to work, where the raw data gets put into form.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is no telling where that next great story, painting, recipe, or business idea is going to come from. Just
        as a surfer can’t control the waves, artists are at the mercy of the creative rhythms of nature. This is why
        it’s of such great importance to remain aware and present at all times. Watching and waiting.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Maybe the best idea
        <br>
        is the one you’re going to
        <br>
        come up with this evening.
