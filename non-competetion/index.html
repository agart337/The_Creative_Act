        Art is about the maker.
        <br>
        <br>
        Its aim: to be an expression of who we are.
        <br>
        <br>
        This makes competition absurd. Every artist’s playing field is specific to them. You are creating the work that
        best represents you. Another artist is making the work that best represents them. The two cannot be measured
        against one another. Art relates to the artist making it, and the unique contribution they are bringing to the
        culture.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some may argue that competition inspires greatness. The challenge of exceeding what others have accomplished can
        act as an incentive to push our creative limits. In most cases, though, this energy of competition oscillates at
        a lower vibration.
        <br>
        <br>
        Wanting to outperform another artist or make a work better than theirs rarely results in true greatness. Nor is
        it a mindset that has a healthy impact on the rest of our lives. As Theodore Roosevelt pointed out, comparison
        is the thief of joy. Besides, why would we want to create with the purpose of diminishing someone else?
        <br>
        <br>
        When another great work inspires us to elevate our own, however, the energy is different. Seeing the bar raised
        in our field can encourage us to reach even higher. This energy of rising-to-meet is quite different from that
        of conquering.
        <br>
        <br>
        When Brian Wilson first heard the Beatles’ Rubber Soul, his mind was blown. “If I ever do anything in my life,
        I’m going to make that good an album,” he thought at the time. He went on to explain, “I was so happy to hear it
        that I went and started writing ‘God Only Knows.’ ”
        <br>
        <br>
        Being made happy by someone else’s best work, and then letting it inspire you to rise to the occasion, is not
        competition. It’s collaboration.
        <br>
        <br>
        When Paul McCartney heard the resulting Beach Boys album, Pet Sounds, he too was blown away and reduced to
        tears, proclaiming “God Only Knows” was to his ears the best song ever written. Buoyed by the experience, the
        Beatles played Pet Sounds over and over while creating another masterpiece, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club
        Band. “Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper never would have happened,” Beatles producer George Martin said. “Pepper
        was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds.”
        <br>
        <br>
        This creative back-and-forth wasn’t based on commercial competition, it was based on mutual love. And we are all
        the beneficiaries of this upward spiral toward magnificence.
        <br>
        <br>
        No system exists that can rank which work is most reflective of the maker. Great art is an invitation, calling
        to creators everywhere to strive for still higher and deeper levels.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is another type of competitiveness that might be seen as an infinite gain: a story that can continue to
        unfold over the course of an artist’s life. This is the competition with the self.
        <br>
        <br>
        Think of self-competition as a quest for evolution. The object is not to beat our other work. It’s to move
        things forward and create a sense of progression. Growth over superiority.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our ability and taste may evolve, yielding different works over time, but none can be evaluated as more or less
        than another. They are different snapshots of who we are, and who we were. They are all our best work in the
        moment they were created.
        <br>
        <br>
        With each new project, we are challenging ourselves to most beautifully reflect what’s living in us at that
        particular window of time.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this spirit of self-competition, task yourself to go further and push into the unexpected. Don’t stop even at
        greatness. Venture beyond.
