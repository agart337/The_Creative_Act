        A seed can be any bit of creative inspiration that might generate into a larger project. For writers a seed
        might be
        a specific emotion to explore, a setting idea, some revelation about human nature, a bit of plot, a character
        sketch.

        Rubin’s most helpful advice here is to simply collect and water at this stage and see what germinates and takes
        root: “As the seeds arrive, forming conclusions about their value or fate can get in the way of their natural
        potential.”
        <br>

        He also notes that when you do get to the stage of deciding which seed to focus on, it will be easier to choose
        when
        you have a lot of options in front of you. If you have just one seed, how can you know it is the best?
