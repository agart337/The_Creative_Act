    <br>
    <br>
    The Creative Act: A Way of Being by Rick Rubin is a book about creativity—not just for artists but for everyone.
    <br>
    <br>
    He believes that creativity isn’t about talent or hard rules; it’s about being open to the world, noticing small
    details, and letting ideas flow naturally. He encourages people to experiment, make mistakes, and not worry too much
    about perfection.
    <br>
    <br>
    Rubin discusses the phases of a creative project, which he calls the Seed phase, the Experiment phase, the Craft
    phase, and the Completion phase.
    <br>

    This website categories some of my favourite chapters into what I think are part of each phase.
