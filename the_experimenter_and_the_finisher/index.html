    <p>
        In their nature, many artists lean toward one of two categories: Experimenters or Finishers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Experimenters are partial to dreaming and play, finding it more difficult to complete and release their work.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finishers are the mirror image, a backward reflection. They move quickly to the end point with immediate
        clarity. They are less interested in exploring the possibilities and alternatives that the Experimentation and
        Craft phases can suggest.
        <br>
        <br>
        Each might find it helpful to borrow from the other.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finishers might benefit from taking more time in the early phases. Writing beyond the minimum requirement,
        experimenting with other materials, considerations, and perspectives. Allowing themselves space for
        improvisation and surprise in the process.
        <br>
        <br>
        Experimenters might benefit from taking an aspect of the work through to completion. It might be a drawing, a
        song,or the chapter of a book. Even making one foundational decision from which to build can help.
        <br>
        <br>
        Take the example of an album. If you’re a musician struggling with ten songs, narrow your focus to two. When we
        make the task more manageable and focused, a change occurs. And completing even a small segment builds
        confidence.
        <br>
        <br>
        Going from two to three is easier than going from zero to two. And if you happen to get stuck on three, then
        skip it and get four and five done.
        <br>
        <br>
        Complete as many elements of the project as you can without getting hung up. It’s much easier to circle back
        once the workload is reduced. Often the knowledge we gain from finishing the other pieces becomes a key to
        overcoming earlier obstacles.
