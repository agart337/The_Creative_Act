        There are no shortcuts.
        <br>
        <br>
        The lottery winner isn’t ultimately happy after their sudden change of fortune. The home built hastily rarely
        survives the first storm. The single-sentence summary of a book or news event is no substitute for the full
        story.
        <br>
        <br>
        We often take shortcuts without knowing it. When listening, we tend to skip forward and generalize the speaker’s
        overall message. We miss the subtleties of the point, if not the entire premise. In addition to the assumption
        that we are saving time, this shortcut also avoids the discomfort of challenging our prevailing stories. And our
        worldview continues to shrink.
        <br>
        <br>
        The artist actively works to experience life slowly, and then to re-experience the same thing anew. To read
        slowly, and to read and read again.
        <br>
        <br>
        I might read a paragraph that inspires a thought, and while my eyes continue moving across the page in the
        physical act of reading, my mind may still be lost in the previous idea. I’m not taking in information anymore.
        When I realize this, I return to the last paragraph I can recall and start reading from there again. Sometimes
        it’s three or four pages back.
        <br>
        <br>
        Re-reading even a well-understood paragraph or page can be revelatory. New meanings, deeper understandings,
        inspirations, and nuances arise and come into focus.
        <br>
        <br>
        Reading, in addition to listening, eating, and most physical activities, can be experienced like driving: we can
        participate either on autopilot or with focused intention. So often we sleepwalk through our lives. Consider how
        different your experience of the world might be if you engaged in every activity with the attention you might
        give to landing a plane.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are those who approach the opportunities of each day like crossing items off a to-do list instead of truly
        engaging and participating with all of themselves.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our continual quest for efficiency discourages looking too deeply. The pressure to deliver doesn’t grant us time
        to consider all possibilities. Yet it’s through deliberate action and repetition that we gain deeper insight.
        <br>
        <br>
        Patience is required for the nuanced development of your craft.
        <br>
        <br>
        Patience is required for taking in information in the most faithful way possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        Patience is required for crafting a work that resonates and contains all that we have to offer.
        <br>
        <br>
        Every phase of an artist’s work and life benefits from cultivating this achievable habit.
        <br>
        <br>
        Patience is developed much like awareness. Through an acceptance of what is. Impatience is an argument with
        reality. The desire for something to be different from what we are experiencing in the here and now. A wish for
        time to speed up, tomorrow to come sooner, to relive yesterday, or to close your eyes then open them and find
        yourself in another place.
        <br>
        <br>
        Time is something that we have no control over. So patience begins with acceptance of natural rhythms. The
        implied benefit of impatience is to save time by speeding up and skipping ahead of those rhythms. Paradoxically,
        this ends up taking more time and using more energy. It’s wasted effort.
        <br>
        <br>
        When it comes to the creative process, patience is accepting that the majority of the work we do is out of our
        control. We can’t force greatness to happen. All we can do is invite it in and await it actively. Not anxiously,
        as this might scare it off. Simply in a state of continual welcoming.
        <br>
        <br>
        If we remove time from the equation of a work’s development, what we’re left with is patience. Not just for the
        development of the work, but for the development of the artist as a whole. Even the masterpieces that have been
        produced on tight timelines are the sum of decades spent patiently laboring on other works.
        <br>
        <br>
        If there is a rule to creativity that’s less breakable than the others, it’s that the need for patience is
        ever-present.
