    <p>
        In most of our daily activities we choose the agenda and develop a strategy to achieve the goal at hand. We
        create the program.
        <br>
        <br>
        Awareness moves differently. The program is happening around us. The world is the doer and we are the witness.
        We have little or no control over the content.
        <br>
        <br>
        The gift of awareness allows us to notice what’s going on around and inside ourselves in the present moment. And
        to do so without attachment or involvement. We may observe bodily sensations, passing thoughts and feelings,
        sounds or visual cues, smells and tastes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through detached noticing, awareness allows an observed flower to reveal more of itself without our
        intervention. This is true of all things.
        <br>
        <br>
        Awareness is not a state you force. There is little effort involved, though persistence is key. It’s something
        you actively allow to happen. It is a presence with, and acceptance of, what is happening in the eternal now.
        <br>
        <br>
        As soon as you label an aspect of Source, you’re no longer noticing, you’re studying. This holds true of any
        thought that takes you out of presence with the object of your awareness, whether analysis or simply becoming
        aware that you’re aware. Analysis is a secondary function. The awareness happens first as a pure connection with
        the object of your attention. If something strikes me as interesting or beautiful, first I live that experience.
        Only afterward might I attempt to understand it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Though we can’t change what it is that we are noticing, we can change our ability to notice.
        <br>
        <br>
        We can expand our awareness and narrow it, experience it with our eyes open or closed. We can quiet our inside
        so we can perceive more on the outside, or quiet the outside so we can notice more of what’s happening inside.
        <br>
        <br>
        We can zoom in on something so closely it loses the features that make it what it appears to be, or zoom so far
        out it seems like something entirely new.
        <br>
        <br>
        The universe is only as large as our perception of it. When we cultivate our awareness, we are expanding the
        universe.
        <br>
        <br>
        This expands the scope, not just of the material at our disposal to create from, but of the life we get to live.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The ability to look deeply
        <br>
        is the root of creativity.
        <br>
        To see past the ordinary and mundane
        <br>
        and get to what might otherwise be invisible.
