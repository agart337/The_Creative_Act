    <p>
        It appears in a moment.
        <br>
        <br>
        An immaculate conception.
        <br>
        <br>
        A divine flash of light. An idea that would otherwise require labor to unfold suddenly blooms in a single
        inhalation. What defines inspiration is the quality and quantity of the download. At a speed so instantaneous,
        it seems impossible to process. Inspiration is the rocket fuel powering our work. It is a universal conversation
        we yearn to be part of.
        <br>
        <br>
        The word comes from the Latin—inspirare, meaning to breathe in or blow into.
        <br>
        <br>
        For the lungs to draw in air, they must first be emptied. For the mind to draw inspiration, it wants space to
        welcome the new. The universe seeks balance. Through this absence, you are inviting energy in.
        <br>
        <br>
        The same principle applies to everything in life. If we are looking for a relationship when we’re already in
        one, then we are full. There is no room for the new to enter. And we are unable to welcome in the relationship
        we want.
        <br>
        <br>
        To create space for inspiration, we might consider practices of quieting the mind: meditation, awareness,
        silence, contemplation, prayer, any ritual that helps us fend off distraction and papancha.
        <br>
        <br>
        Breath itself is a potent vehicle to calm our thoughts, create space, and tune in. It cannot guarantee that
        inspiration will come, though the vacancy may draw the muse in to play.
        <br>
        <br>
        Taken more spiritually, inspiration means to breathe life into. An ancient interpretation defines it as the
        immediate influence of the divine. For the artist, inspiration is a breath of creative force drawn in instantly
        from outside of our small selves. We can’t be sure where this spark of insight originates. It’s helpful to know
        it’s not us alone.
        <br>
        <br>
        When inspiration does arrive, it is invariably energizing. But it is not something to rely on. An artistic life
        cannot be built solely around waiting. Inspiration is out of our control and can prove hard to find. Effort is
        required and invitations are to be extended. In its absence, we may work on other areas of the project
        independent of this cosmic transmission.
        <br>
        <br>
        Epiphanies are hidden in the most ordinary of moments: the casting of a shadow, the smell of a match igniting,
        an unusual phrase overheard or misheard. A dedication to the practice of showing up on a regular basis is the
        main requirement.
        <br>
        <br>
        To vary your inspiration, consider varying your inputs. Turn the sound off to watch a film, listen to the same
        song on repeat, read only the first word of each sentence in a short story, arrange stones by size or color,
        learn to lucid dream.
        <br>
        <br>
        Break habits.
        Look for differences.
        Notice connections.
        <br>
        <br>
        One indicator of inspiration is awe. We tend to take so much for granted. How can we move past disconnection and
        desensitization to the incredible wonders of nature and human engineering all around us?
        <br>
        <br>
        Most of what we see in the world holds the potential to inspire astonishment if looked at from a less jaded
        perspective. Train yourself to see the awe behind the obvious. Look at the world from this vantage point as
        often as possible. Submerge yourself.
        <br>
        <br>
        The beauty around us enriches our lives in so many ways. It is an end in itself. And it sets an example for our
        own work. We can aim to develop an eye for harmony and balance, as if our creations have always been here, like
        mountains or feathers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ride the wave as long as it can be ridden. If you are fortunate enough to experience the strike of inspiration,
        take full advantage of the access. Remain in the energy of this rarefied moment for as long as it lasts. When
        flowing, keep going.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you’re a writer and you tap into a stream of ideas before bed, you may want to stay with it until dawn. If
        you’re a musician and you’ve reached your goal of creating one song or ten songs, yet the music is still coming,
        capture all you can.
        <br>
        <br>
        The work yielded may not be used in the current project, but it may be of use another time. Or it may not. The
        task of the artist is simply to recognize the transmission and stay with it in gratitude, until it truly runs
        its course.
        <br>
        <br>
        In terms of priority, inspiration comes first. You come next. The audience comes last.
        <br>
        <br>
        These are special moments and are to be treated with the utmost devotion. Our schedules are set aside when these
        fleeting moments of illumination come. Summon your strength and commit yourself on behalf of this offering, even
        when it arises at an inopportune time. This is the serious artist’s obligation.
        <br>
        <br>
        John Lennon once advised that if you start a song, write it through to the end in that sitting. The initial
        inspiration has a vitality in it that can carry you through the whole piece. Don’t be concerned if some of the
        parts are not yet all they can be. Get through a rough draft. A full, imperfect version is generally more
        helpful than a seemingly perfect fragment.
        <br>
        <br>
        When an idea forms, or a hook is written, we may feel that we’ve cracked the code and the rest will take care of
        itself. If we step away and let that initial spark fade, we may return to find it’s not so easy to rekindle.
        Think of inspiration as a force not immune to the laws of entropy.
