    <p>There are times during the Craft phase when you hit a wall and the work isn’t getting any better. Before
        stepping away from the piece, it’s worth finding a way to break the sameness and refresh your excitement
        in the work, as if engaging with it for the first time.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the recording studio, I occasionally suggest exercises to artists with this goal in mind. We attempt
        them without expectations regarding outcome. The intention is simply to rekindle excitement and access
        new ways of performance.
        <br>
        <br>
        Several of these exercises follow. Whether or not you find yourself at an impasse, perhaps they can
        inspire similar experiments in your chosen field.

        Small Steps
    </div>
    <p>
        To create movement for a musician who was blocked, we offered him a small task: write just one line
        every day. It didn’t matter how good or bad he felt about the line, as long as he committed to writing
        it. If more came through, that was fine but not necessary. By breaking down what seemed insurmountable
        into single lines, he was able to reopen the creative channel and eventually began composing entire
        songs again. This happened much more quickly than expected.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="subset">
        Change the Environment
    </div>
    <p>
        If we’re looking for a performance of a different nature, it can help to change an element of the
        environment. Turning off the lights and playing in the dark can create a shift in consciousness and
        break the chain of sameness from performance to performance. Other shifts we’ve experimented with
        include having a singer hold the microphone instead of standing in front of it, and recording early in
        the morning instead of at night. To access a greater degree of variation, one vocalist chose to hang
        upside down while singing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="subset">
        Change the Stakes
    </div>
    <p>
        Besides changing the external environment, you can also change the inner. If a band imagines that this
        is the last time they’ll ever play a particular song, they’re likely to perform it differently than if
        it’s just another take. Other times lower stakes, such as doing a rehearsal prior to recording, may
        bring out the best performance.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="subset">
        Invite an Audience
    </div>
    <p>
        When an artist thrives on being in front of a crowd, we may bring in several people to watch a session.
        Being observed changes how an artist acts. Even if the audience consists only of one person who isn’t
        part of the project, that can be enough. While some artists may overdo a performance for an audience and
        others may hold back, most tend to be more focused with someone else present. Even if your art is
        non-performative, such as writing or cooking, it will still likely change with an observer present. The
        goal is to find the specific parameters in each case that bring out your best.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="subset">
        Change the Context
    </div>
    <p>
        There are times when a singer doesn’t connect with a song, like an actor whose line reading falls flat.
        It can be helpful to create a new meaning or an additional backstory to a song’s lyrics. A love song
        might sound different if sung to a long-lost soulmate, a partner of thirty years that you don’t get
        along with, a person you saw on the street but never spoke to, or your mother.
        <br>
        <br>
        With one artist, I suggested singing a love song written to a woman as a devotional to God instead. We
        can try many different permutations while singing the same song, without changing any of the lyrics, to
        see which version brings out the best performance.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="subset">
        Alter the Perspective
    </div>
    <p>
        A technique we sometimes use in the studio is to turn up the volume on the headphones extremely loud.
        When every sound explodes in your ears, there’s a natural tendency to play much quieter to restore the
        balance. It’s a forced perspective change, and can bring out a very delicate performance. Even vocals
        will be whispered, because anything more than that would be overwhelming. Conversely, to coax someone to
        sing louder, with more energy, I might ask them to turn the vocal volume down in their headphones so
        their voice is drowned out by the music. Whatever the situation, if a task is challenging to accomplish,
        there’s often a way to design the surroundings to naturally encourage the performance you’re striving
        for.
        <br>
        <br>
        In a concert, setting up the lighting so that the performer either sees the crowd and the faces in it or
        can’t see anyone at all will alter the performance. If a performer uses in-ear monitors and all they
        hear is the music they’re playing and not the audience response, it will be very different than if the
        screaming of the crowd is mixed in. It’s worth experimenting with different scenarios to observe what
        they bring out and to find the performance you want.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="subset">
        Write for Someone Else
    </div>
    <p>
        In the case of a musician who typically writes their own material, I’ll suggest, “Imagine that a
        favorite artist asked you to write a song for their next album.
        <br>
        <br>
        What would that song sound like?”
        <br>
        <br>
        By creating something you’d be excited to hear your favorite artist perform, it depersonalizes the
        process and can allow the writer to break free of themself. A quintessential song of female empowerment,
        “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” was written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin. King—and then, of
        course, Aretha Franklin—sang it. I was surprised to learn that Goffin wrote the lyrics and King the
        music.
        <br>
        <br>
        At times, I will ask the musician to select an artist whose lyrics and point of view are very different
        from their own, as a way to avoid the sameness that can occur in a career over time. If an artist is
        normally full of braggadocio, we may choose a more vulnerable, soft-spoken lyricist. If you tend to
        write in style x, it can be interesting to choose an artist who is the polar opposite of x. This doesn’t
        mean the song will be good. It’s just interesting to see where it leads. And sometimes it leads you
        right where you’re going.
        <br>
        <br>
        Like the other exercises, this can be applied to any craft. If you’re a painter, creating an original
        new work by your favorite artist can open a channel and lead to interesting results. Many artists have a
        perceived idea of what’s in their wheelhouse, and that’s ultimately a limitation. So it’s helpful to
        step out of yourself and into someone else’s wheelhouse.

    <div class="subset">
        Add Imagery
    </div>
    <p>
        I was working on an album and the band was struggling with the keyboard solo. The mood wasn’t right. We
        wanted something more grand. So instead of a musical reference, we created a scene. We came up with a
        description of the aftermath of a battle: “Imagine there’s a beautiful green hill covered in trees and
        flora, just breathtaking, and a battle has just ended. Smoke drifts off the hill and reveals wounded
        soldiers scattered along it, waiting for help to arrive.” We painted the scene very vividly, then said,
        “Play the solo like that,” and hit record. The keyboardist began playing beautifully.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since then, it’s been a technique we’ve continued to use. Often, we don’t even know what the connections
        are between the image and what we want to hear. Thinking of a specific image or story, or imagining that
        you’re scoring a film and then starting to play, will often bring a stronger direction to a meandering
        tune.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="subset">
        Limit the Information
    </div>
    <p>
        When a songwriter sends a demo of a track for a band to record in the studio, I don’t want the musicians
        to in any way be informed by the musical choices made for the demo. So I’ll typically have one musician,
        usually a guitar player, listen to it and learn the chords, notate them on the lyric sheet, and give
        that to the band.
        <br>
        <br>
        The guitar player and the singer may then perform it, with no suggestion of rhythm other than the speed
        implied by the way they play it.
        <br>
        <br>
        When you’re working with great musicians, this leaves them free to bring in more of themselves. Rather
        than recording a good version of the demo, they will use the full range of their creativity and
        decision-making abilities to take the song somewhere new and often unexpected. If the results aren’t
        great after trying different approaches, they can always listen to the demo at that point, though that
        rarely happens.
        <br>
        <br>
        The general principle is to be protective and limit people you’re working with from experiencing things
        that could interfere with their creative process. Limit the information to the barest of sketches. If
        you want creators to bring all of themselves to something, give them the most freedom to create. If you
        give a screenwriter a book, an outline, or a sentence to turn into a script, each will lead to a very
        different screenplay.
        <br>
        <br>
        These exercises are not set in stone. The intention is to establish different perspectives or
        conditions, and see where you or your collaborators end up. Consider creating your own versions of these
        experiments. Or if using these specific ones, feel free to change the parameters as you’re working or
        remove them altogether when the time is right. The actual exercises are of little importance. The
        purpose is to set up a structure to go beyond your usual method and find new ways forward.
