    <p>
        Distraction is one of the best tools available to the artist when used skillfully. In some cases, it’s the only
        way to get where we are going.
        <br>
        <br>
        When meditating, as soon as the mind quiets, the sense of space can be overtaken by a worry or a random thought.
        This is why many meditation schools teach students to use a mantra. An automatic, repeated phrase leaves little
        room in the mind for thoughts that pull us out of the moment.
        <br>
        <br>
        The mantra, then, is a distraction. And while certain distractions can take you out of the present moment,
        others can keep the conscious part of yourself busy so that the unconscious is freed up to work for you. Worry
        beads, rosaries, and malas work in the same way.
        <br>
        <br>
        When we reach an impasse at any point in the creative process, it can be helpful to step away from the project
        to create space and allow a solution to appear.
        <br>
        <br>
        We might hold a problem to be solved lightly in the back of our consciousness instead of the front of our mind.
        This way, we can remain present with it over time while engaging in a simple, unrelated task. Examples include
        driving, walking, swimming, showering, washing dishes, dancing, or performing any activity we can accomplish on
        autopilot. At times, physical movement can spur ideas to move too.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some musicians, for example, do a better job of writing melodies while driving than sitting in a room with an
        audio recorder on. These types of distractions keep one part of the mind busy while freeing the rest to remain
        open to whatever comes in. Perhaps this process of nonthinking thought allows us to access a different part of
        our brain. One that can see more angles than the direct path.
        <br>
        <br>
        Distraction is not procrastination. Procrastination consistently undermines our ability to make things.
        Distraction is a strategy in service of the work.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes disengaging
        <br>
        is the best way to engage.
